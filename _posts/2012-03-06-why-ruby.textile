These days a lot people asked me why I chose ruby.
I am talking about the language, not the Rails Framework built on top of Ruby. 
Lots of people gets confused with Ruby and Rails.
But i will admit that I was fascinated towards Ruby through Rails. 
I will save Rails for another post.

<pre>
Why Ruby,
With Ruby I can express myself through computer with less and
beautiful code. The code which you will love and wants to flaunt it.
Ruby makes you think differently to write beautiful code with 
clear thinking and creatively.
</pre>

<strong>P.S.</strong> It's not just infatuation but I am in Love with Ruby.
