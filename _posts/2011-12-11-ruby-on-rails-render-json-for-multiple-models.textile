title: Ruby on Rails to_json with include

If the models aren't associated through active record, then fetching json data is pretty simple in Ruby on Rails.
<code>
respond_to do |format|
  format.json  { render :json => @order}
end
</code>

If an association does exist, you can pass an :include argument to the render call, like so:

<code>
respond_to do |format|
  format.json  { render :json => @order.to_json(:include => [:payments])}
end
</code>
