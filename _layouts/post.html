<h2>Looking for comments?</h2>

<p>I don't have comments on this site as they're difficult to manage and take up too much time. I'd rather concentrate on producing content than managing comments.</p>

<p>Since there are no comments, feel free to contact me ✉️ <a href="/contact">contact me</a> instead.</p>
