<p>Yesterday i was working on destroy action of a model in. Before deletion I had to check whether the model has any child model or not. Even the model has child model, but deletion was successful even though i had set to false.</p>

<p>So i got curious and checked the rails issues. There i got to know a important concept of position of different members of model class in rails.</p>

<p>In my case i had placed belongs_to, has_many, validations and then callbacks.</p>

<p>So if I am using before_destroy, the rails follows the same sequence in my model. It first deletes the associated models if dependent destroy is mentioned, then checks for validations and then my before_destroy callback where i had explicitly told it to return false if child model size &gt; 0. But since child model are already destroyed the size is 0 and my condition in before_destroy fails.</p>

<p>The solution is to place before_destroy above all.</p>

<p>So now rails will call callbacks first and then associations and validations.</p>

<p>It also helps in reducing the number of sql queries executed. In my case it reduced from 25 to 5. pretty good.</p>
