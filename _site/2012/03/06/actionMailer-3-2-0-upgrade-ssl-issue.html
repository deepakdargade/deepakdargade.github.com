    <p>06 Mar 2012</p>

<p>I upgraded my Rails app to Rails 3.2.0 from 3.1.3 and found that my SMTP outgoing mail was no longer able to authenticate with my mail server.</p>

<p>Further investigation revealed that my ActionMailer config was using the configuration option</p>

<pre>
:tls =&gt; true,
</pre>

<p>which is now effectively</p>

<pre>
:enable_starttls_auto =&gt; true.
</pre>

<p>But of course. After that quick change it worked.</p>

<p>The specific error message I was seeing was:</p>

<pre>
OpenSSL::SSL::SSLError: SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed.
</pre>
