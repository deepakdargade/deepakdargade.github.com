<p>Git is a Distributed VCS, and if you have experience with Subversion or CVS before it, you need to change your mind.</p>

<p>Git is a very agile and you can use different workflows with it. Cloning repositories is more needed for a team work, not for local development (IMHO).</p>

<p>Branches is a good alternative for you.</p>

<p>See. Let’s set master branch of your repository for a production-ready pre. Let’s create another branch for development:</p>

<pre>
$ git checkout -b development master
</pre>

<p>Now you are working on the development branch.</p>

<p>You could use different branches for each feature you want to develop. It’s very easy and helpful.</p>

<p>Let’s imagine you want to implement some new feature, you need to create a new branch:</p>

<pre>
$ git checkout -b newfeature development
</pre>

<p>Now you can work with your pre, add files, commit and so on.</p>

<p>Next you need to merge your new developed feature to the development branch:</p>

<pre>
$ git add .
</pre>
<pre>
$ git commit -m "My last changes for the new feature"
</pre>
<pre>
$ git checkout development $ git merge newfeature
</pre>

<p>Now your new pre from the newfeature branch merged into the development branch.</p>

<p>For sometime in the future when you decide that your pre in the development branch get some milestone, you could merge all the changes from development to master branch.</p>

<p>It’s a very basic workflow, it can be helpful for the many branches.</p>

<p>My advise for you now: read more about git, branching, stashing (very-very-very helpful for quick fixes). And after some time you will get a great effort from using git.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>
